## üßë‚Äçüíª LOCAL INSTALLATION & SETUP
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to set up the `.env` file.  
> .env file must contain **MONGODB_URI**, **PORT**, **MAIL_USERNAME**, **MAIL_PASSWORD**, **CLOUD_NAME**, **API_KEY**, **API_SECRET**, **JWT_SECRET**
> Kindly note : If you want to run on your own backend, then you will have to change the api calls in frontend to your custom api
```bash
cd backend        # Move to backend folder
npm install       # Install required dependencies
node server.js     # Start backend server on specified PORT in .env file (https://localhost:PORT)
 
cd ..             # Move back to root folder
cd frontend       # Move to frontend folder
npm install       # Install required dependencies
npm run dev       # Start frontend on port 5173 (https://localhost:5173)
```


## üìù DESCRIPTION
- You can upload files (please see file types can only be pdf or image)
- During uploading you can also set up a date for file expiry
- After uploading and refreshing you can see your uploaded file name
- You can also share the file to your friends via email and they will get a shortened url for the file you shared
- Node-cron will automatically delete file from database after expiry date has arrived

## üîÆ FUTURE SCOPES
- Using Redis for caching for improving response time in url shortner
- Adding more file handling features like deleting the file, updating expiry date etc.
- Not only deleting record from database but also deleting from cloudinary
- Implementing Google signin and signup
